As russia destroys our infrastructure and communications in order to be able to work and communicate with each other, we have to adapt our approach to this.
## Meetings
1. As before, plan and create meetings (in Google Calendar, etc.), but only as an approximate time.
2. When one of the parties does not have electricity at this time, we act as follows:
	* who has electricity and the Internet, is trying to contact the other party, and reschedule the meeting, or have a meeting right now, since no one can predict the loss.

## Work process
1. Let's imagine that we work a full working week (40 hours)
	* we work when we have the opportunity (internet and electricity) and try to reach 40 hours a week.
2. We sleep when there is no electricity or Internet.
3. If 40 hours cannot be reached (yet), to fill the missing time, we work on weekends and national holidays.

## How to help others
 * Enable guest passwordless access on your Wi-Fi router (perhaps with speed limitation)
